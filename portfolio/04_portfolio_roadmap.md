## Risk Adjustments

### Contingency Planning

**Scenario 1: GreenLens Phase 2 Delay (2 weeks)**
- **Impact:** Predictive Maintenance kickoff delayed
- **Mitigation:** Overlap planning with development, parallel workstreams
- **Buffer:** 2-week buffer in Q2 for Predictive Maintenance

**Scenario 2: Key Hire Delay (AI Engineer)**
- **Impact:** Predictive Maintenance development slowed
- **Mitigation:** Contractor support, scope reduction to MVP
- **Buffer:** 1-month buffer in timeline

**Scenario 3: Customer Pilot Withdrawal**
- **Impact:** Validation delayed, no real-world data
- **Mitigation:** Multiple pilot candidates, synthetic data fallback
- **Buffer:** 3 backup customers identified

**Scenario 4: Technical Complexity (Higher than expected)**
- **Impact:** Model development takes 50% longer
- **Mitigation:** Phased approach, reduce scope to core features
- **Buffer:** 4-week buffer per project phase
