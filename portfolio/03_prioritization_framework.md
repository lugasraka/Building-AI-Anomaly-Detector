# AI Portfolio Prioritization Framework
## Scoring Model, Decision Criteria & Governance

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** February 2026  
**Purpose:** Standardize project prioritization and resource allocation decisions

---

## Prioritization Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Data-Driven:** Decisions based on objective scoring, not politics
2. **Strategic Alignment:** Projects must advance business and platform goals
3. **Value-Focused:** Prioritize high-impact, feasible initiatives
4. **Balanced Portfolio:** Mix of quick wins and long-term bets
5. **Transparent:** Clear criteria visible to all stakeholders

**Decision Authority:**
- **Strategic Decisions:** Steering Committee (VP level)
- **Tactical Priorities:** Program Manager + Product Lead
- **Sprint-Level:** Team self-organization within priorities

## Trade-Off Analysis

### Scenario: Resource Constraint

**Situation:** Team can only deliver 2 of 4 projects this quarter

**Analysis:**
1. **GreenLens AI** - Must continue (foundation, revenue)
2. **Predictive Maintenance** - High ROI, start if possible
3. **Demand Forecasting** - Defer to next quarter
4. **Occupancy Optimization** - Defer to H2

**Decision:** Focus on GreenLens + Predictive Maintenance

**Rationale:**
- GreenLens: Already deployed, scaling = immediate value
- Predictive: Highest ROI, customer demand
- Defer others: Lower scores, can wait

---

### Scenario: Strategic Opportunity

**Situation:** Major customer requests Occupancy Optimization for 50 buildings

**Analysis:**
- Current score: 3.65 (P2)
- Opportunity: Large deployment, reference customer
- Risk: Technical feasibility concerns (privacy, hardware)

**Decision:** Fast-track to P1 with conditions

**Conditions:**
1. Proof-of-concept in 2 buildings first
2. Privacy impact assessment
3. Customer funds pilot
4. Success criteria defined upfront

**Revised Score:** 4.2 (conditional P1)

---

### Scenario: Technical Discovery

**Situation:** Predictive Maintenance data quality issues discovered

**Analysis:**
- Current score: 4.39 (P1)
- Issue: 40% of buildings lack sufficient sensor data
- Impact: Feasibility drops from 3.8 to 2.5

**Decision:** Downgrade to P2, pivot approach

**New Approach:**
1. Subset of buildings with good data (P1)
2. Data collection initiative for others (P2)
3. Synthetic data research (P3)

**Revised Score:** 3.8 (feasibility risk)
