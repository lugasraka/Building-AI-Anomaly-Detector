## Portfolio Impact Summary

### Job Requirements Match

**Before Portfolio Documentation:**

- No evidence of multi-project management
- Missing: Roadmap, prioritization, resource allocation

**After Portfolio Documentation (Current):**
- 4-project portfolio with clear priorities
- Scoring framework for decision-making
- Resource allocation strategy
- Strategic roadmap alignment

**Match Improvement:**
- Before: ~70% (technical + team leadership)
- After (current): ~85% (+15% for portfolio management)
- Target (after completion): ~90-95%

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete All Portfolio Files
Continue with remaining 4 files:
- Portfolio roadmap timeline
- Resource allocation details
- Program metrics framework
- Risk management register

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Result:** Complete portfolio management demonstration

### Option 2: Pause and Review
Review current progress, then decide on completion strategy

**Benefit:** Validate direction before investing more time

### Option 3: Focus on Key Gaps Only
Create only the most critical missing files (roadmap + risk management)

**Time:** 1 hour  
**Result:** Good enough for job application

---

## Recommendation

**Suggested Path:** Complete all 7 portfolio files

**Rationale:**
1. You're 43% complete (3 of 7 files)
2. Remaining files are straightforward (templates already established)
3. Complete portfolio management is a key differentiator
4. Only 2-3 hours additional work
5. Will bring portfolio match to ~90-95%

**Alternative:** If time-constrained, prioritize:
1. `04_portfolio_roadmap.md` (visual timeline)
2. `07_risk_management.md` (critical for governance)

This would achieve ~88% match with minimal additional effort.
