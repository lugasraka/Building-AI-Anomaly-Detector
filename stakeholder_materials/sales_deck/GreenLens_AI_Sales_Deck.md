## Slide 2: The Energy Waste Crisis

### The Problem: Hidden Inefficiencies Cost Millions

**Industry Context:**
- Commercial buildings waste **15-30% of energy** due to undetected HVAC inefficiencies
- Average 100,000 sq ft building: **$50,000-$150,000** in annual energy waste
- Traditional monitoring catches only **20%** of operational issues
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): **Days to weeks** for equipment failures

**Customer Pain Points:**
> *"We know we're wasting energy, but we can't pinpoint where or why"*  
> — Facility Manager, Commercial Real Estate

> *"By the time we notice a problem, we've already lost thousands in energy costs"*  
> — Operations Director, Manufacturing Plant

**The Gap:**
- Rule-based systems generate **false alarms** (threshold fatigue)
- Manual analysis is **reactive, not predictive**
- No correlation between **energy patterns and operational context**

## Slide 4: Solution Overview

### GreenLens AI: Contextual Anomaly Detection

**What It Does:**
AI-powered system that monitors building energy consumption and identifies operational inefficiencies **before** they become costly failures

**Key Innovation:**
Unlike threshold-based systems ("Alert if Temp > 25°C"), GreenLens detects **contextual anomalies**:
> *"High energy consumption during cool weather indicates stuck dampers"*

**How It Works:**

```
Sensor Data → AI Engine → Business Intelligence → Actionable Insights
     ↓            ↓              ↓                    ↓
13 Variables   <50ms latency   Financial Impact    HVAC Schedule
Energy/Temp/   96% confidence  CO2 Tracking        Maintenance
Occupancy/     Anomaly scores  $ Cost Analysis     Alerts
HVAC Status
```

**Core Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Real-time Detection** - <50ms inference latency
- ✅ **Contextual Analysis** - Correlates 13 variables simultaneously
- ✅ **Financial Translation** - Converts anomalies to $ cost impact
- ✅ **Sustainability Metrics** - Tracks CO2 reduction automatically
- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis** - Identifies HVAC, schedule, equipment issues
